$License Plate Recognition System with RTSP Stream Integration

This project is a real-time license plate recognition system using RTSP camera feeds. It detects and extracts vehicle license numbers using ONNX models, controls gate operations via API requests, and logs data in an SQL Server. The system supports multithreading for real-time performance and provides a user interface for monitoring.
